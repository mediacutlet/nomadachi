# Nomadachi

A Pwnagotchi plugin that turns roaming into a game. **Nomadachi** tracks the unique places your gotchi discovers and awards XP for exploration. It shows a compact travel title + place count on the UI, e.g.:

```
Trav Homebody (2pl)
```

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Places counter** ‚Äî counts unique places discovered (GPS grid cells or band-only fallback)
- **Travel XP** ‚Äî awards XP for first-time encounters (ESSIDs, BSSIDs, OUIs, bands, places)
- **Titles** ‚Äî unlock fun titles as XP increases (configurable thresholds)
- **Minimal UI** ‚Äî one tidy line: `Trav <title> (<places>pl)`
- **Persistent** ‚Äî progress is saved to disk and restored on boot
- **Migration** ‚Äî can import travel stats from the Age plugin

## üõ† Installation
1. **Copy the plugin file to your Pwnagotchi**

   Place `nomadachi.py` at:
   
   ```
   /usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/nomadachi.py
   ```

2. **Enable it in `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml`**

   ```toml
   # --- Nomadachi ---
   [main.plugins.nomadachi]
   enabled = true

   # UI position (pixels)
   x = 92
   y = 74

   # GPS grid (degrees). 0.01 ‚âà ~1.1 km cells
   travel_grid = 0.01

   # If no GPS is available, treat each band as a single "place"
   # so one neighborhood doesn't mint dozens of places.
   strict_nogps_places = true

   # XP tuning for first-time encounters
   xp_essid = 2
   xp_bssid = 1
   xp_oui   = 1
   xp_band  = 2
   xp_place = 10

   # Optional: UI text format (tokens: {title}, {level}, {places})
   format = "{title} ({places}pl)"

   # One-time migration from Age plugin's /root/age_strength.json travel fields
   migrate_from_age = true

   # Optional: override title thresholds (XP ‚Üí Title). Keys must be strings in TOML:
   # titles."0" = "Homebody"
   # titles."200" = "Wanderling"
   # titles."600" = "City Stroller"
   # titles."1200" = "Road Warrior"
   # titles."2400" = "Jetsetter"
   # titles."4800" = "Globetrotter"
   ```

3. **Restart Pwnagotchi**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart pwnagotchi
   sudo journalctl -u pwnagotchi -n 120 --no-pager
   ```

## üß≠ How it works
**Places**
- With **GPS**: Nomadachi quantizes latitude/longitude to a grid (default `travel_grid = 0.01¬∞`) and counts new grid cells as new places.
- Without GPS: the fallback is **band-only** (e.g., `nogps-2.4`, `nogps-5`, `nogps-6`), preventing a dense neighborhood from creating many ‚Äúplaces.‚Äù

**Travel XP** *(first-time encounters per handshake)*
- +`xp_essid` for a **new ESSID**
- +`xp_bssid` for a **new BSSID**
- +`xp_oui` for a **new vendor OUI** (first 3 MAC bytes)
- +`xp_band` for a **new band** (2.4/5/6 GHz)
- +`xp_place` for a **new place**

Titles change as your **total XP** crosses configured thresholds.

---

## üñ• UI
Nomadachi renders a compact line on the display. Default format:

```
Trav <title> (<places>pl)
```

Customize via `format` in the config (available tokens: `{title}`, `{level}`, `{places}`).

---

## üíæ Persistence
Data is stored at:

```
/root/pwn_traveler.json
```

Delete this file to reset your progress (Nomadachi will recreate it).

---

## üîÅ Migrating from the Age plugin
If you previously used an Age plugin variant with travel fields, Nomadachi can import from:

```
/root/age_strength.json
```

Set `migrate_from_age = true` (default) and keep that file present for the first run.

---

## üîß Tips & Tuning
- **Make "places" denser:** decrease `travel_grid` (e.g., `0.005` ‚âà ~550 m).
- **Slow down rank ups:** reduce XP values and/or raise title thresholds.
- **Disable fallback liberal places:** keep `strict_nogps_places = true`.
- **Disable Nomadachi travel in Age:** set `main.plugins.age.enable_travel = false` if your Age plugin also has travel code.

---

## üß™ Development
- Standalone plugin file: `nomadachi.py`
- Class implements standard Pwnagotchi plugin hooks: `on_loaded`, `on_ui_setup`, `on_ui_update`, `on_handshake`
- Thread-safe JSON persistence with a lock
- Zero network dependencies; works fully offline
